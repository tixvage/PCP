# PCP
**THIS LANGUAGE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!**

PCP is a simple language inspired by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and [Jai](https://github.com/BSVino/JaiPrimer/blob/master/JaiPrimer.md), currently written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Examples

planned simple 'Hello, World':


```pcp
io :: @import "IO";

main :: () void {
    io.println("Hello, World\n");
}
```
